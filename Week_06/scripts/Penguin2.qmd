## Introduction
Today, we are learning about how to work with figures and themes

## Load the libraries

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(kableExtra)
```
## Make a plot

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| fig-height: 4
#| label: fig-penguin-1
#| fig-cap: "This is a figure showing bill length by bill depth."


penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species))+
  geom_point()
```


When you look at @fig-penguin-1 we can see there is a positive relationship between bill length and bill depth.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-penguin
#| tbl-cap: "My awesome table"
#| warning: false

penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(billmean = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  kbl()  %>% # make it a kable table
  kable_classic() %>%
  row_spec(2, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "red")%>% # highlight row 2
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) # don't make it so wide
```

This is @tbl-penguin
